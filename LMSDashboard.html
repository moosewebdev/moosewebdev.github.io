            <p class="textLight">To gain comprehensive insights into the rationale for implementing a Learning Management System (LMS), as well as the specific objectives and requirements of beta partners and LMS administrators, a research approach combining qualitative interviews and surveys was undertaken. This approach aimed to uncover the strategic motivations for LMS adoption and to capture the unique perspectives of key stakeholders.</p>
            
            <p class="textLight">The research commenced with in-depth interviews conducted with beta partners, organizations from various industries considering LMS implementation. The interviews aimed to uncover the primary business goals motivating their interest in adopting an LMS: </p>

            <ol>
              <li><strong>Enhanced Workforce Skills:</strong> A common business goal emerged, centered around the desire to enhance employee skills, ensuring a skilled workforce capable of meeting evolving industry demands.</li>
              <li><strong>Efficient Training Management:</strong> Organizations sought to streamline training processes, reduce training-related costs, and ensure a consistent training experience across departments and locations.</li>
              <li><strong>Scalable Learning Solutions:</strong> The desire for scalable learning solutions was evident, with organizations looking to accommodate growth, onboard new hires, and provide continuous development opportunities.</li>
              <li><strong>Compliance and Certification:</strong> Compliance and certification needs were a key driver, particularly for industries with strict regulatory requirements. An LMS was seen as a tool to ensure compliance training and documentation.</li>
          
            </ol>

            <p class="textLight">To encompass diverse viewpoints, interviews were also conducted with LMS administrators, individuals responsible for managing the LMS platform. The goals and needs highlighted included: </p>

            <ol>
              <li><strong>Effective Content Management:</strong> LMS administrators emphasized the need for intuitive content creation, organization, and management tools to ensure relevant and up-to-date learning materials.</li>
              <li><strong>Data-Driven Insights:</strong> Administrators expressed interest in analytics features that provide insights into user engagement, training effectiveness, and areas for improvement.</li>
              <li><strong>Personalization Capabilities:</strong> The importance of offering personalized learning experiences was noted, with administrators seeking tools to tailor content to different user roles and skill levels.</li>
              <li><strong>User Management and Support:</strong> Administrators valued user management features, such as user enrollment, progress tracking, and tools for addressing user inquiries.</li>
          
            </ol>

            <p class="textLight">The research findings underscored the alignment of business goals and user needs, indicating a shared emphasis on skill enhancement, efficiency, and adaptability. The insights further highlighted the role of the LMS in bridging these objectives, offering a platform to strategically meet organizational goals while equipping administrators with tools to efficiently manage learning initiatives.</p>

            <p class="textLight">As organizations increasingly recognize the significance of cultivating a skilled and adaptable workforce, the need for a robust Learning Management System (LMS) emerges as a strategic imperative. In this context, our aim is to address the challenge of efficiently managing employee learning and development while catering to the diverse goals and needs of both stakeholders and administrators.</p>

            <p class="textLight">To address these challenges and requirements, our solution revolves around the development of an intuitive and feature-rich admin dashboard. This dashboard empowers administrators with tools that enable user management, course creation, data-driven insights, personalization capabilities, and more. It serves as a centralized hub where administrators can efficiently orchestrate the learning journey for their workforce, ensuring alignment with organizational objectives.</p>

            <p class="textLight">We needed to understand how ArmorLock(AL) technology works.</p> 
            
            <p class="textLight">ArmorLock drives currently ship in a locked state. The default state of the drive is locked, every time the drive is plugged in, it will be locked. In order for the drive to be unlocked a user needs to have authorization to the drive. The initial setup of the drive is done using take ownership flow. This syncs the AL app with the drive and allows the user(Manager) to unlock/lock and authorize additional users/managers.</p> 

            <p class="textLight">How this new feature would work is that security and encryption is always on, but we can toggle the boot sequence to start in the unlocked state allowing users to always have the plug and play experience. While in the unlocked state the drive can be used by anyone without the AL app. Users and managers can still use the AL app and features.</p>

            <p class="textLight">Lets familiarize our self with the current high level user journey.</p>
